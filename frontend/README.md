# Flutter Frontend (sports_mcommerce)

This is a minimal Flutter app skeleton for the Home screen (sports theme) that connects to the included backend.

Important:
- Update `backendBase` in `lib/main.dart` if you run the backend somewhere other than localhost/emulator.
- For Android emulator use `10.0.2.2:3000`. For iOS simulator or real device, use the machine IP address.

Run:
1. cd frontend
2. flutter pub get
3. flutter run
