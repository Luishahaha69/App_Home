# sports_mcommerce_project

This repository contains:
- frontend/ : a minimal Flutter app skeleton (Home screen + Login).
- backend/  : a minimal Node.js + Express backend with JWT authentication and endpoints.

Notes:
- The Flutter UI is styled to resemble the reference image but themed for sports.
- Update the backendBase constant in lib/main.dart when running backend on a different host.
- For Android emulator, backendBase = http://10.0.2.2:3000 is set by default.

Good luck! Upload both folders to your Git repository (Codespaces) and run backend + frontend.
